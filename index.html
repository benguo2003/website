                Hi there, my name is Junbin Guo, but I prefer to go by Ben. I am a junior at San Marino 
                High School(SMHS) located in Los Angeles, California. I have a strong passion for computer science
                and enjoy programming as a whole.

                                weekly meetings in order to prepare for competitions in the BML, or
                                Bay Math League. I participate in the 10, 11, and 12th grade tests,
                                as well as the AMC 12.

                                I am preparing to compete in the USNCO, or the U.S. National Chemistry Olympiad.

                            <span>I am an organizer of TitanHacks. At my school,
                                many students associate programming with undecipherable useless nonsense, 
                                rather than what it actually is: a tool to make. At TitanHacks, we introduce 
                                members to concepts and tools and foster an environment of creativity so that, 
                                hopefully, members will be self-motivated to learn and produce. We hope to cumulate 
                                the 2019 year with a intraclub hackathon and finish the 2019-2020 school year 
                                with a publicly availible hackathon.

                            <span>During the summer of my jump from middle school to high school,
                                I participated in 2 ID Tech Camps at Caltech. Both courses were a week
                                long, with one focused on Java and the other on Python. These two courses are 
                                the two of my most important experiences, as they hooked my attention and 
                                got me into programming and computer science.

                            <span>It seems that all my experiences have to do with Caltech somehow; oh well.
                                In my junior in high school(current year), I enrolled into my school's Caltech
                                STEM Research Program, in which different groups teamed up with Caltech professors
                                and mentors in discovering various topics of research. My group, the Machine Learning group,
                                was fortunate enough to have Dr. Babak Hassibi to guide us in researching many ML areas such
                                as Graph Clustering and Neural Networks.
